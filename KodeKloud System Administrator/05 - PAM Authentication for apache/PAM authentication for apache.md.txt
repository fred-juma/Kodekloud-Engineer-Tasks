PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module) Authentication For Apache


We have a requirement where we want to password protect a directory in the Apache web server document root. We want to password protect http://<website-url>:<apache_port>/protected URL as per the following requirements (you can use any website-url for it like localhost since there are no such specific requirements as of now). Setup the same on App server 3 as per below mentioned requirements:



a. We want to use basic authentication.

b. We do not want to use htpasswd file based authentication. Instead, we want to use PAM authentication, i.e Basic Auth + PAM so that we can authenticate with a Linux user.

c. We already have a user kareem with password Rc5C9EyvbU which you need to provide access to.

d. You can access the website using APP button on the top bar.

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
