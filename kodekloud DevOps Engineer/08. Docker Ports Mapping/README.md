#### Scenario

The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to host an application on a nginx-based container. There are number of tickets already been created for similar tasks. One of the tickets has been assigned to set up a nginx container on Application Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. Please perform the task as per details mentioned below:



a. Pull *nginx:stable* docker image on Application Server 1.

b. Create a container named *cluster* using the image you pulled.

c. Map host port *8089* to container port *80*. Please keep the container in running state.



#### Solution

SSH into application server 1

```bash
thor@jump_host ~$ ssh tony@172.16.238.10

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System

Use docker run command to pull and deploy the container. the options used are:

+ --name: container name
+ -d: run container in detached mode
+ - p: specify ports. 8089 for host port and 80 for container port
+ nginx:stable: image name

```bash
[root@stapp01 tony]# docker run --name cluster -d -p 8089:80 nginx:stable

Verify that the image is pulled, and container is created and running

```bash
[root@stapp01 tony]# docker ps
