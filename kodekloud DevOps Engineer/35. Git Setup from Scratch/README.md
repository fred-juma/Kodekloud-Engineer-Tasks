#### Task

Some new developers have joined xFusionCorp Industries and have been assigned Nautilus project. They are going to start development on a new application, and some pre-requisites have been shared with the DevOps team to proceed with. Please note that all tasks need to be performed on storage server in Stratos DC.



a. Install git, set up any values for user.email and user.name globally and create a bare repository /opt/cluster.git.

b. There is an update hook (to block direct pushes to master branch) under /tmp on storage server itself; use the same to block direct pushes to master branch in /opt/cluster.git repo.

c. Clone /opt/cluster.git repo in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster directory.

d. Create a new branch xfusioncorp_cluster in repo that you cloned in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos.

e. There is a readme.md file in /tmp on storage server itself; copy that to repo, add/commit in the new branch you created, and finally push your branch to origin.

f. Also create master branch from your branch and remember you should not be able to push to master as per hook you have set up.


#### Solution

SSH to Storage Server

```bash

thor@jump_host ~$ ssh natasha@ststor01

Install git

```bash

[natasha@ststor01 ~]$ sudo yum install git-all -y

```

Configure git global username and email

```bash
[natasha@ststor01 ~]$ git config --global user.name "natasha"
[natasha@ststor01 ~]$ git config --global user.email natasha@.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
[natasha@ststor01 ~]$ 
```

Verify the global configs

```bash

[natasha@ststor01 games.git]$ git config --list
user.name=natasha
user.email=natasha@.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
[natasha@ststor01 games.git]$ 
```


Create a bare repository

```bash
[natasha@ststor01 ~]$ sudo git init --bare /opt/games.git
Initialized empty Git repository in /opt/games.git/
[natasha@ststor01 ~]$
``` 


Navigate into the remote repo and view the contents

```bash
[natasha@ststor01 ~]$ cd /opt/games.git/
[natasha@ststor01 games.git]$ ls -l
total 36
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Feb 25 11:35 â€“bare

```

Copy the hook from */tmp/* to the repo

```bash
[root@ststor01 games.git]# cp /tmp/update hooks/
```

Navigate to the new directory *kodekloudrepos*

```bash
[root@ststor01 update]# cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/
[root@ststor01 kodekloudrepos]# 
```

Clone the games repo into this new directory

```bash
[root@ststor01 kodekloudrepos]# git clone /opt/games.git
Cloning into 'games'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
done.
[root@ststor01 kodekloudrepos]# 
```

Navigate into the cloned repo

```bash
[root@ststor01 kodekloudrepos]# cd games/
```

Create the *xfusioncorp_games* branch

```bash
[root@ststor01 games]# git checkout -b xfusioncorp_games
Switched to a new branch 'xfusioncorp_games'
[root@ststor01 games]# 
```

Copy the */tmp/readme.md* file to the repo and verify successful copy

```bash
[root@ststor01 games]# cp /tmp/readme.md .
[root@ststor01 games]# ls -l
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 33 Feb 25 12:01 readme.md
[root@ststor01 games]# 
```

Check git status

```bash
[root@ststor01 games]# git status
# On branch xfusioncorp_games
#
# Initial commit
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#       readme.md
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

git add *readme.md* 

```bash
[root@ststor01 games]# git add readme.md 
```

git commit *readme.md*

```bash
[root@ststor01 games]# git commit -m "create readme"

```bash
[root@ststor01 games]# git checkout -b master
Switched to a new branch 'master'
[root@ststor01 games]#
